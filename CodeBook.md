#CodeBook This file explains the data generated by running therun_analysis.R script.

#Input

The data used on this script can be found here.

The data is on a folder called UCI HAR Dataset, we will only need the following files:

activity_labels.txt

features.txt

subject_test.txt

subject_train.txt

X_test.txt

X_train.txt

y_test.txt

y_train.txt

For the script to work you need to put the UCI HAR Dataset on your R working directory.

#Output

It creates a tidy.csv which contains the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

The datasets will be saved on your working directory.

#Variables

variables are just the calculatd means and standard deviations of these sets of data - one each for the X, Y and Z dimensions:

tBodyAcc-X

tBodyAcc-Y

tBodyAcc-Z

tBodyGyro-X

tBodyGyro-Y

tBodyGyro-Z

Each of these has a mean and standard deviation version. Examples:

tBodyAcc-mean()-X: Mean of base body acceleration data in the X dimension

tBodyGyro-std()-Y: Standard deviation of base body gyroscope measurement in the Y dimension
